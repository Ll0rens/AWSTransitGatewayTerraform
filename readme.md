# Instructions for running the command terraform apply -var 'vpc_count'=4

## Prerequisites
- Terraform installed on your local machine
- AWS credentials configured on your local machine

## Steps
1. Download the Terraform configuration files for creating VPCs in AWS.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the configuration files.
3. Create a file called `terraform.tfvars` with the following content:

vpc_count = 4


4. Run the following command to initialize Terraform:

terraform init

5. Run the following command to verify that Terraform can create the resources correctly:

terraform plan


6. If everything looks good, run the following command to create the VPCs:

terraform apply -var ‘vpc_count’=4


7. Wait for the operations to complete and verify that the VPCs have been created successfully in the AWS console.

That's it! You should now have 4 VPCs created in your AWS account.

I hope this helps. Is there anything else I can help you with?
